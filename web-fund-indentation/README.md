# Indentation Practice

## Use `git` & `GitHub` to Set Up This Assignment

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Navigate to the repository on GitHub and fork it to your own account.

2. **Clone the Repository**
   - Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone <repo-url>
     ```

3. **Indent the HTML Code**
   - Open the HTML files in your text editor and properly indent the code for improved readability.

4. **Commit and Push Changes**
   - After making your changes, commit them with a descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Fix HTML indentation"
     ```
   - Push the changes to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push
     ```

5. **Submit the Assignment**
   - Provide the link to your forked repository when submitting the assignment.

We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Let's get started with improving the code!

Fix the Code: Open partI.html in your preferred text editor (e.g., VS Code) and tidy up the indentation to make the HTML code more readable and organized. Proper indentation will help you understand the structure of the code better.

Analyze the Structure: In partII.html, you'll encounter HTML tags that may be unfamiliar. While you may not know all the tags yet, you can still practice identifying the relationships between elements. Focus on determining the parent, child, and sibling relationships among the tags by properly indenting the code. This exercise will help you visualize the hierarchical structure of HTML documents.

Happy coding!
